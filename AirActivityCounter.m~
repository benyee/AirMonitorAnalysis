%Inputs:
%   t_in = timestamps corresponding to each entry in E
%   bin = bin #'s for each event, should be same size as t_in
%   conv - see binToE, will be used to convert bin #s to energies
%   N = number of total counts per data point (higher = less data points,
%       but more accurate.  lower = more data points, less accurate)
%   binROI = 2x1 array of integers indicating the lower and upper bin numbers.
%       Peak of interest should be >=ROI(1) and <=ROI(2).
%   See PeakFit.m for description of remaining inputs
